"""
Test module for fizz_buzz function in the FizzBuzz game.
Contains tests for standard cases, edge cases, and defensive assertions.

Test categories:
    - Standard cases: typical user inputs and expected game results
    - Edge cases: empty input, invalid input, and quitting the game
    - Defensive tests: wrong input types, assertions
